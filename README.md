This Java program solves the Tower of Hanoi puzzle using three towers represented by arrays (tower1, tower2, tower3). It starts with disks on tower1 and uses a method called Towers to move the disks to tower3, using recursion (repeated function calls). The method, moveDisk, moves the disks between the towers. The program shows/prints the state of the towers before and after solving the puzzle.
